# Prosper Loans Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding loan accounts by the company Prosper from 2005 to 2014.  The main analysis was to see how specific borrower characteristics changed over time.  Those borrower characteristics included variables such as but not limited to credit score, loan status, and prosper rating.

## Summary of Findings

During the exploration I found that there was signigicant in company policy after 2009.  This policy included a minimum credit score of 650 as opposed to not having a minimum credit score prior to 2009.  This change led to a decrease in principal loss for the company.  I categorized Loan Status to either "Achieving" or "Non-Achieving" for simplicity.  An achieving loan was a loan that was completed or paid off.  A non-achieving loan consisted of a loan that was charged-off, defaulted, or delinquent.  The proportion of achieving loans to non-achieving loans steadily decreased after 2009 when the new policies were put into place. Another finding was Prosper Rating, which is Prospers custom risk rating, saw that the higher ratings(less-risk) saw higher proportion of achieving loans to non-achiving loans as well. Over all the best predictors of loan status were credit score and income.  Income saw a higher proportion of achieving to non-achieving loans as the income increased.   

## Key Insights for Presentation

The biggest insights for this presentation the discovery of how loans performed over time and the corresponding borrower characteristics.  After exploring the data it was obvious that after 2009 the company set a minimum credit score for recieving a loan and in turn the company started losing a lot less money.  I also looked for what borrower characteristics best predicted loan status.  It was found that credit score and subsequently Prosper Rating along with income were the best.
